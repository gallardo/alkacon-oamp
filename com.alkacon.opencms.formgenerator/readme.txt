1. Module functions

The webform module makes it possible to create input forms for collection of  
data website visitors enter without knowledge of HTML. These so called webforms
are created by mouse clicks and some text input. One can select from different 
input field types. It is possible to define the label, default value and options for 
the input element. Captcha verification is also supported. The resulting data 
of a submission may be sent to a configurable email and / or be stored in the 
OpenCms database.
