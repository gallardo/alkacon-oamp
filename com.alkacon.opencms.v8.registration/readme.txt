1. Module functions

The Alkacon OAMP Webuser Registration module an be used to easily create a
community site where a user login is required.

The module makes it possible to create both a custom webuser registration
form and a webuser profile edition form, without the need of programming any
Java, JSP or HTML. The webuser registration forms can be easily created and
have all optional functionalities provided by the webforms module, like
configurable input fields, confirmation page, captcha field and confirmation
email. Additionally you can use an 'activation link' to have users
confirming the registration before activating the account. This module also
includes two additional page elements to include in a template, one small
frontend login form and an information box about the registered and online
users.

This module depends on the Alkacon OAMP Webform module, and requires at
least version 1.1 of this module.
