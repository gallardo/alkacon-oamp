##About OAMP##

---
The [Alkacon OpenCms Add-On Module Package](http://www.alkacon.com/oamp/) (also called OAMP) is a set of free, open source extension modules for [OpenCms](http://www.opencms.org). Alkacon OAMP adds front-end related features to OpenCms that may be useful in case special functionalities are required.


The Alkacon OAMP modules are installed on a standard OpenCms system.
