1. Module functions

With the Survey module, it is possible to create and analyze a survey. Based on the Webform 
Module, it is possible to create highly configurable survey forms without knowledge of HTML. 
Once created, configured and published, a survey can be filled out by website visitors.  The 
analysis of the survey can easily be done by creating and configuration a survey report.
